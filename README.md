Alpha - Personal Portfolio of work

Simple webpage that highlighted a few pieces of work from classes at Oregon State University

To Access:
1) git clone
2) Using web browser, open file index.html

The website includes two project links:
1) Simple HTML/CSS html page highlighted customizing an image
2) A real-time stock quote app that used REST API calls to IEX to get stock quotes for user defined stock symbols. The API calls are now "out of date".
